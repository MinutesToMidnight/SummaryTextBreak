Description of Methods:
1) TextTiling
TextTiling implements an iterative algorithm which has 3 functions called at different levels of splitting.
First it tries to split the text into paragraphs by semantic meaning. It is basically done by using embeddings
and the angle between the embeddings of documents. On this level the problem of similar semnatic meaning of every segment
may be encountered.
If the length of a single paraghram exceeds the limit of tokens, the algorithm breaks the paragraph into sentences. After that
each sentence gets appended to the current segment until its limit. Then a new segment is created.
If the length of a single sentence exceeds the limit of tokens, which is rarely the case, then the sentence is broken into parts
by punctuation as the natural signs in a text. Two previous level may have the problem of losing the context of the previous parts.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Since the each segment is processed a constant amount of times, but not once in general case.

2) SlidingWindowOverlapping
This method greedily gets segments of the text by moving the window of a fixed size. To remain the context the overlapping is added.
Such implementation implies repetition, i.e. the model may generate similar result multiple times. The longer the length of overlap,
the more context the model gets, but the more risk it gets to repeat the information. You can adjust the overlap size parameter manually.
Time complexity: O(n)

Also you can choose the amount of tokens in the range [100, 1024] that the model will see in a single segment. Usually the models are
trained and fine-tuned with 512 and 1024 tokens. Prefer choosing above 500 tokens as a limit.
Compression ratio defines the maximum length of the summary as the percentage of the length of the original text:
max_len_summary = len(source_text * compression_ratio)
It guarantees that the summary will not be longer than the defined limit. If the limit is less than the amount of tokens the model can see,
the limit will be extended to the token limit of the model.
Thus, for longer documents lower number of compression ratio is preferred. If you are unsure what ratio to choose, adjust it to maximum - 0.9
If the compression ratio is too strict (lower values) the summary might be uncertain or slightly confusing.

Further comparison of models and methods will be demonstrated using the following parameters:
compression_ratio = 0.8
token_limit = 550
overlap_size = 0.2

Technology and Innovation
In the 21st century, technology is rapidly changing the face of the world around us.
From the proliferation of artificial intelligence and machine learning to quantum computing and robotics, we are witnessing an exponential growth of opportunities in a wide variety of fields.
Artificial intelligence has long since ceased to be an element of science fiction and has become an integral part of our daily lives.
Computer vision, natural language processing and autonomous control systems are developing so rapidly that machines are increasingly becoming partners in solving complex problems.
At the same time, issues of data security, privacy and ethics remain pressing, requiring developers and researchers to find a balance between technological advances and the protection of human rights.
New technologies also open up prospects for sustainable and energy-efficient systems, which is becoming especially important in a resource-intensive world.
Scientific discoveries and research
Modern science continues to make discoveries that are revolutionizing our understanding of the world.
Research in cosmology provides a glimpse into the depths of the universe and insight into the mechanisms of galaxy formation, while nuclear physics and elementary particle research are
deepening the enormous questions of the origin of matter.
Biotechnology and genetics are opening the door to personalized medicine, making it possible to treat previously untreatable diseases, while neuroscience research is providing insights into the intricate workings of the human brain.
Modern interdisciplinary approaches allow scientists to combine knowledge from different fields: physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics, creating new methodologies and transforming the way we think about research.
In every lab around the world, today's scientists are paving the way for new theories, experiments and technologies that could change the future of humanity.
Climate change and ecology
Climate change has become one of the most pressing challenges of our time.
Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events and declining biodiversity require drastic action by the global community.
Ecologists and climate scientists are sounding the alarm, calling for a shift to renewable energy sources, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and preserving the planet's unique ecosystems.
Active research is being conducted in the field of sustainable development, and innovative solutions are being developed to purify water, recycle waste and create environmentally friendly technologies.
In this context, international agreements aimed at reducing the global environmental impact, as well as the efforts of individual countries and regions striving to create a “green economy” play an important role.
Economy and Globalization
Today's global economy is characterized by a high degree of interdependence and dynamic change.
The growth of the digital economy, the emergence of blockchain technologies and the rapid development of financial technologies are having a significant impact on traditional business models.
While globalization enables countries to share ideas, technology and resources, it also brings new challenges in the form of economic instability, income inequality and competition for scarce resources.
The rapid transition to a digital economy raises issues of intellectual property protection and the security of financial transactions, which stimulates the development of legal and regulatory mechanisms
at the international level. Companies operating in this space have to quickly adapt to changes, implement innovative solutions and rethink their strategies in an ever-changing world.
Culture and Art
The cultural heritage of humankind and the unbreakable link to tradition have always been a source of inspiration and identity for society.
In today's digital age, art is taking on new forms and opportunities for self-expression. The emergence of digital painting, virtual reality and interactive installations opens a limitless space for
artists to create and experiment. Intercultural dialog is becoming more intense thanks to the global network, where traditional ideas and contemporary trends are reflected in film, music, literature and performance.
However, along with this comes the problem of loss of uniqueness, when traditional cultures risk dissolving into the general flow of global trends. Contemporary art tries to find a balance between preserving authenticity
and integration into the global cultural space, reflecting the complexity and multifaceted nature of human experience.
Social change and societal transformation
Changes in the social structure of modern societies affect the basis of human interaction. The development of social networks, mobile communication and digital platforms has changed the ways of communication,
allowing people to be closer despite physical distances. This has led to new forms of sociocultural exchange characterized by increased interactivity and rapid dissemination of information.
However, with these benefits have also come certain risks: the spread of misinformation, cyberbullying, identity leaks and digital addiction have become pressing challenges for the global community.
In this context, the role of the state and the private sector in regulating digital communications, preserving privacy and protecting citizens from abuse becomes an important issue.
Education and scientific and technological progress
Education is one of the key factors in the development of society, especially in an era of rapid technological change. Modern educational institutions are actively adopting digital technologies, which
allows not only to expand access to knowledge, but also to create interactive educational programs. Online courses, virtual classrooms and educational platforms are becoming an integral part of learning,
providing opportunities for continuous professional development in a rapidly changing labor market. The introduction of artificial intelligence in the educational process promotes personalized learning,
which helps to take into account the individual characteristics of each student. Such changes promote the development of critical thinking skills, creativity and flexibility necessary for successful functioning
in the new digital world.
Philosophy and ethics
The modern world poses a number of questions for humanity that go beyond purely technical or economic issues. Philosophy, ethics and morality play an important role in assessing the implications of rapid changes
in society. Many contemporary thinkers are asking how new technologies affect human identity, freedom of choice, and personal development. These questions become especially relevant in the age of digitalization,
when the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds are blurred. Reflections on the meaning of life, social justice and moral norms help society to adapt to new conditions, find answers to the challenges of the
time and strive for harmonious personal development. Ethical dilemmas associated with the use of biotechnology, AI and genetic engineering require scientists and legislators to carefully analyze and develop mutually
acceptable solutions that contribute to the well-being of all humankind.
International relations and politics
Global politics in the 21st century is characterized by constant changes and transformations. Various countries and regions seek to protect their interests, but situations arise when international cooperation becomes
an indispensable tool for solving global problems - from fighting terrorism to regulating migration flows. Contemporary powers and alliances are forced to revise their strategies against the backdrop of new challenges
such as cyber threats, financial crises and climate change. Leading world powers are actively engaged in diplomatic dialogues, signing multilateral agreements aimed at strengthening stability and secure development.
International organizations such as the UN, the World Bank and the WTO play an important role in coordinating efforts, helping to create a legal framework for cooperation in the context of globalization.
Health and lifestyle
The evolution of ideas about health and quality of life reflects changes in society, when people began to pay more attention not only to physical condition, but also to psycho-emotional well-being. Advances
in medicine, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology allow for accurate diagnosis and individualized treatment regimens that improve longevity and quality of life. In addition, modern technology has made a significant
contribution to the promotion of healthy lifestyles: mobile applications, wearable devices and digital platforms help people to monitor physical activity, diet and sleep quality. Attention to mental health has also
become a priority, reflected in the growing popularity of meditation, yoga and psychological support practices. Together, these changes are contributing to a holistic approach to health, where physical and emotional
well-being are seen as integral components of a fulfilling life.
The future of humanity and foresight scenarios The question of the future has always preoccupied people's minds, and today, with the pace of technological development reaching unprecedented heights, this topic has
become even more relevant. Visions of the future range from utopian scenarios of unlimited prosperity to dystopias that warn of the possible catastrophic consequences of uncontrolled technological development.
Many scientists and futurologists predict that in the coming decades we will witness changes that will affect all areas of life, from the global economy to the structure of society and modes of interpersonal communication.
By combining advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, space research and biotechnology, humanity can reach a whole new level of development, but this path comes with considerable responsibility for the future of the planet.
Literature, art and self-expression
Literature and art have always been the mirror of the human soul, reflecting the innermost thoughts and experiences of generation after generation. In the digital age, traditional art forms are experiencing a renaissance,
merging with new media and techniques. Contemporary writers and artists are experimenting with form and content, creating works that can touch deep emotional strings while offering fresh perspectives on traditional themes.
The influence of social media and online platforms has opened up new avenues for self-expression, allowing creative individuals from around the world to share their work across borders and cultural barriers.
This creates a dynamic and diverse cultural space where old traditions meet new ideas, giving birth to unprecedented art forms.

Margaret Douglas had been the petted of great men and strong men ever since she could remember. She had known Maud Lindsay (called the “Snarer of the Heart’s”) in her best time. To end thus, to be despatched like a bale of goods at sixteen years of age out of Scotland! Tinkle-tankle!_ “You have looked upon a man--a mortal sin!” said she. “Well, people do not die of it. So did my mother before me!” “No, no,” I said, willing to appease her if possible. “He was no man really, only a wild savage, black as a Moor of Barbary” He bent down to disengage me gently, murmuring in Scots, “Wait a little while!” And then he stretched out two fingers over my head and said in a voice full of the music which first made my uncle take him to Dulce Cor as a chorister, “Bless you, my child!” “These behind there do not matter!” Larry whispered to me, “These behindthere do not matter” Two French girls were sent to the Sign of the Bald Cat to repent themselves of their sins. The Bald Cat took it, fumbling meanwhile for the pieces of Veniceglass set together in an oval frame with water between them. It was in Latin, and so after turning it this way and that, she gave it back to the Abbot Laurence, who stood before her, tall and young and fair to look upon. A man appeared in an ample “pelicon,” or pelisse, longer than was then in vogue, but with a rich under-garnishing of fur. This garment had a wide rolling rollingcollar, all covered over with the Bloody Heart of the Douglases. The man was indeed a marvel to behold, and at the sight of him the High Lady Superior ordered all her pensionnaires back to their cells. But to my surprise and vexation he rebuked me for it, saying that William of Avondale was worth all the rest of the family put together. Larry turned away without speaking, and that made me a little sorry. But ah, the inward happiness to be among men again after two years! I was just beginning to learn what I could do with the hearts of men. I did not know the power which had come to me during these years. “I will not be married like this, here and now,” I cried; “signed for,” “taken from custody, guarded, delivered, and the note acquitted.” “Margaret Douglas, that am Princess of Galloway, and but eighteen years of age!” The king was at Amboise. He would make me a maid of honour in his court. That would be easy. "I did not know the way to Amboise very exactly, but I had heard that it lay away to the west" "I was not really dragged, but no matter--that was the way I liked to think about it then" "I seemed to hear the shouting of the shouting of the enemy behind me — of my pursuers, I mean" But as for me, I answered him in Scots. For I knew him at the first glint. They do not breed such magnificent beasts in the land of France. “The Fair Maid o’ Galloway!” he said, as if stiff-stricken. “Certes, but ye are grown indeed--and bonny as the day. Gie your kinsman a kiss for stopping that reckless galloper o’ yours” Cour Cheverney was a means of furthering my education, and, by incident, that of several other people as well. My chief joy and safety, in thus completing of my education, was that everyone knew that I was so soon to be married--by high pontifical dispensation, papal Bull, holy cord, and four pounds of wax. I would hand him a viol and hush the company with my hand. For, if left alone, they were bound to hear a marvellous thing. Songs of lost love he would sing, of desolate low shores and maids yet more desolate. Sadder and sadder the ballad would grow, till, with a sudden fling of the elbow, Larry would dash into some mirthful lilt of old Scottish song. Ay, and hold thread for the winding, too, between these same thrice-blessed fingers!” “Ah, that I were your father,” he murmured, low and bitter in mine, “or your mother, ay--or even the Abbess of St. Brigida two days later!” I demanded. “Faith, I would like it greatly,” said James. “I ask no better!” he said in Scots. “Cousin Marget, ye will see me whammle them!”

And others do not really really want to count, as I have seen” "I was just beginning to learn what I could do with the hearts of men," he says. "To be beautiful and to turn men between their fingers is the Thing Desired of the Heart" "Even in old age, I judge that this is the second best thing which can happen to a woman," he adds. "To be beautiful and to turn men between their fingers is the Thing Desired of the Heart" "Even in old age, I judge that this is the second best thing which can happen to a woman," he adds. "The absolute best, the gold centre of all, is that during her love-time she should have known one man good, and true, and great" Margaret Douglas, Princess of Galloway, was on her way to Amboise to meet the King of France. The king was at Amboise--Charles, the King of France, and would make her a maid of honour in his court. She did not want to be married, at least not so soon, and have done with her girlhood before she had ever tasted it. Margaret of Galloway was married to the Earl of Douglas, the Duke of Touraine. She lived at Cour Cheverney with her cousin Will of Avondale, the Earl of Avondale and his wife, Lady Superior. Laurence, who, being a prelate, or, at least, having thepowers of one, could not go a-hunting. Among the country lords and Knights-of-the-Green-Fields, easily bore the gree.

And then there came the Lady Superior, and she was the Lady Superior of St. Brigida of Cheverney. And then I was glad to see Larry... “Ay, my lady, I am to take you to marry my Cousin William--my Lord Earl of Douglas.” “Ay,” said Laurence, “you are to go with me.” “ “Ay!” I cried. “Ay! Or aiblins would ye kill a poor lass? Na, surely never!” “Ay!” he said. “And the lads at Thrieve?” “Well, well enough,” he said, a little indifferently. “And if I cried, I would be a maid of honour in his court. And without words more I turned. Ciel!

And there was James Douglas, who, being a prelate, could not go a-hunting.. but he made infinite work with his tackle, sitting beside me on that same seat.. the harp.

And as for that renegade Englishman, Bevis Roland, I could beat him at all but the jousting. For that was our big James, root and branch of him, ready, self-confident, never blate, everyway large, never he he had made me Queen of Beauty; and as for James, he thought that he had nothing else to do but lift the jewel--a black diamond circled all about with points of brilliants and sapphires--which certainly would have become me Queen of Beauty.

Varlet, having had no exercise for weeks at the convent, only Larry, who did not matter at all, understanding, I was resolved to make the most of our stay at Cour Cheverney. Cour Cheverney and the dance beneath the Judas tree were good enough for me. James could not dance well. He was too big of bone, and too fair. Only dark men dance well.
